# Welcome to DnD Notes!
---
There are lots of ways to track your DnD campaign online these days, however, in the cursory search I made prior to starting work on this site I didn't see \
one specifically for taking notes. Dndbeyond is great but the notes tab wasn't going to be enough to handle my 'Keen Mind' feat after my DM threatened violence if I didn't \
start writing things down.

So, here we are.

### Features
---
This site basically allows for quick and dirty wiki creation.

You create different categories of things which you want to keep track of - campaigns, locations, items, etc. - \
then link them together. This allows for you to quickly see all related content to the thing you are looking at.

This site is still pretty early on in development, so if there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please \
submit a feature request on the GitHub repo linked below.

### Technical Details
---
I'm about to list out a bunch of stuff here but if you really want to dig through how things work go check out \
the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/landrevj/dndnotes).

#### Frameworks
This site runs on [Ruby on Rails 5.2.2](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v5.2.2) using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) 2.5.3. \
I am also using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling structure.
#### Accounts
The [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem is used here to handle user accounts. This made it easier for me to get things \
up and running quickly and will likely provide more security features than I would have the know-how to implement.
#### Other Gems Used

* [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) for authorization
* [Rails Admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) for an admin dashboard
* [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) for markdown support
* [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) for code highlighting
  * I really don't know why I installed this for a DnD site, but maybe your character dreams in C# or something and wants to keep a dream journal
  * This can still be used to make distinct looking sections of text so w/e

The exact list of gems used can be found [here](https://github.com/landrevj/dndnotes/blob/master/Gemfile).
