# [DnD Notes](https://thawing-fjord-31293.herokuapp.com/)
There are lots of ways to track your DnD campaign online these days, however, in the cursory search I made prior to starting work on this site I didn't see one specifically for taking notes. Dndbeyond is great but the notes tab wasn't going to be enough to handle my 'Keen Mind' feat after my DM threatened violence if I didn't start writing things down.

So, here we are.

## Features
This site basically allows for quick and dirty wiki creation.

You create different categories of things which you want to keep track of - campaigns, locations, items, etc. - then link them together. This allows for you to quickly see all related content to the thing you are looking at.

This site is still pretty early on in development, so if there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please submit a feature request.
