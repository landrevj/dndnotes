# [DnD Notes](https://thawing-fjord-31293.herokuapp.com/)
There are lots of ways to track your DnD campaign online these days, however, in the cursory search I made prior to starting work on this site I didn't see one specifically for taking notes. Dndbeyond is great but the notes tab wasn't going to be enough to handle my 'Keen Mind' feat after my DM threatened violence if I didn't start writing things down.

So, here we are.

## Features
This site basically allows for quick and dirty wiki creation.

You can create:

* Notes - Shocker, I know. These consist of a name, description, and general content. The last two of these are Markdown enabled. 
* Links - These connect Notes and allow you to quickly denote and navigate related content.
* Categories - These contain the Notes.
* Workspaces - These contain Categories. Categories which belong to a workspace do not show up in others. The UI for creating links does not permit linking notes from different categories. This allows you to have multiple isolated spaces to work in without things getting cluttered.

This site is still pretty early on in development, so if there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please submit a feature request.
